Based on the Moderator architecture, here's a 5-gear progression from MVP to full implementation:

## **5 Gears of Moderator Development**

### **⚙️ Gear 1: Single-Agent Linear Execution (Week 1)**
*"Proof of Life" - Can we orchestrate code generation and review it?*

**Core Functionality:**
- **One Backend Only**: Just CCPM or Claude Code (pick one)
- **Simplified Moderator**: Basic task decomposition + manual PR review
- **No TechLead/Monitor**: Moderator does everything sequentially
- **Manual Improvements**: Human identifies what needs fixing

**What Works End-to-End:**
- Input requirements → Generate code → Create PR → Human reviews → Done
- Basic logging and state persistence
- Simple Git integration (create branch, commit, PR)

**Value Delivered:**
- Validates core orchestration concept
- Establishes PR-based workflow
- Tests basic code generation quality

---

### **⚙️ Gear 2: Two-Agent System with Auto-Review (Week 2)**
*"The Core Loop" - Automated review and basic improvements*

**Added Functionality:**
- **Moderator + TechLead** separation of concerns
- **Automated PR Review**: Moderator reviews TechLead's work
- **Basic Feedback Loop**: TechLead addresses review comments
- **One Improvement Cycle**: After initial implementation, do one round of improvements

**What Works End-to-End:**
- Requirements → Task decomposition → Implementation → Auto review → Feedback incorporation → One improvement → Done
- Basic health monitoring (token counting, error tracking)
- Sequential task execution (one task at a time)

**New Value:**
- Automated quality gates
- Basic self-improvement capability
- Reduced human intervention

---

### **⚙️ Gear 3: Multi-Backend + Parallel Execution (Week 3)**
*"The Orchestrator" - Use the right tool for each job*

**Added Functionality:**
- **Multiple Backends**: CCPM + Claude Code + Mock agents
- **Task Router**: Intelligently selects backend per task type
- **Parallel Execution**: Multiple tasks in flight
- **Monitor Agent**: Active health monitoring and alerts
- **Basic Specialists**: Can spawn test_specialist or doc_specialist

**What Works End-to-End:**
- Complex projects with multiple components
- Parallel PR creation and review
- Automatic backend selection based on task type
- Health monitoring prevents runaway execution

**New Value:**
- Handles real-world projects (not just toys)
- 3-5x faster through parallelization
- Better quality through specialized tools

---

### **⚙️ Gear 4: Ever-Thinker + Learning System (Week 4)**
*"The Self-Improver" - Continuous enhancement and learning*

**Added Functionality:**
- **Ever-Thinker Agent**: Runs continuously in background
- **Multi-Cycle Improvements**: Until diminishing returns
- **Learning Database**: Tracks patterns and outcomes
- **Advanced Specialists**: Full specialist roster (API, refactoring, security)
- **Context Management**: Smart pruning and checkpoint recovery

**What Works End-to-End:**
- Never considers work "done" - always improving
- Learns from accepted/rejected PRs
- Handles context overflow gracefully
- Can run for hours autonomously

**New Value:**
- Code gets better over time (not just "working")
- System gets smarter with each project
- Handles large codebases without context issues

---

### **⚙️ Gear 5: Full Self-Healing Production System (Week 5-6)**
*"The Autonomous Platform" - Self-managing, self-healing, self-evolving*

**Added Functionality:**
- **Self-Healing**: Automatic error recovery and system repair
- **Advanced Learning**: Cross-project pattern recognition
- **Custom Agent Creation**: Define new specialists via natural language
- **Multi-Project**: Orchestrate multiple projects simultaneously
- **Real-time Dashboard**: Full observability and intervention UI
- **Plugin Architecture**: Extensible backend system
- **Distributed Execution**: Can scale across multiple machines

**What Works End-to-End:**
- Complete autonomous development platform
- Self-modifying (can improve its own code)
- Handles enterprise-scale projects
- Full production monitoring and alerting
- API/SDK for integration with other tools

**New Value:**
- Platform, not just a tool
- Can improve itself
- Enterprise-ready
- Ecosystem extensibility

## **Key Design Principles Across Gears**

### **Every Gear is Fully Functional**
- Gear 1: Generates working code with human review
- Gear 2: Generates and reviews code automatically  
- Gear 3: Builds complete systems with parallel execution
- Gear 4: Continuously improves everything it builds
- Gear 5: Self-managing autonomous development platform

### **Progressive Complexity**
- Each gear adds ~40% complexity
- New capabilities build on proven foundation
- Can stop at any gear and have value
- Later gears can be deferred based on needs

### **Risk Mitigation**
- Gear 1-2: Prove core concept works
- Gear 3: Prove scale and orchestration
- Gear 4: Prove continuous improvement
- Gear 5: Production hardening

---

## **Recommended Implementation Strategy**

### **Start Here (Gear 1)**
```python
# Simplest possible working system
class SimpleOrchestrator:
    def execute(self, requirements):
        tasks = self.decompose(requirements)
        for task in tasks:
            code = self.generate_code(task)  # One backend
            pr = self.create_pr(code)
            print(f"PR created: {pr.url}")
            input("Review and press enter...")  # Manual review
```

### **Validate Before Advancing**
Only move to next gear when:
- Current gear works reliably
- Core value proposition is proven
- You understand the pain points to solve

### **Gear Decision Points**

**Stay at Gear 2 if:** You just need basic automation for personal projects

**Advance to Gear 3 if:** You're building real applications with multiple components

**Advance to Gear 4 if:** Code quality and continuous improvement matter more than speed

**Advance to Gear 5 if:** You need production reliability and team collaboration

## **Time/Resource Estimates**

| Gear | Dev Time | Complexity | Value Delivered | When to Stop Here |
|------|----------|------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| 1 | 3-5 days | Low | 50% automation | Personal proof-of-concept |
| 2 | 1 week | Medium | 70% automation | Small personal projects |
| 3 | 2 weeks | Medium-High | 85% automation | Team projects, startups |
| 4 | 3 weeks | High | 95% automation | Quality-critical projects |
| 5 | 4-6 weeks | Very High | 99% automation | Enterprise, SaaS platform |

**Bottom line**: Start with Gear 1 to validate the core idea works. Each gear is a complete, usable system. You might find Gear 3 is all you ever need.
