# Moderator System Architecture Diagrams

This directory contains comprehensive architecture and flow diagrams for the Moderator system. These diagrams illustrate the system's design, workflows, and key components using Mermaid notation.

## Understanding the Gear System

Moderator follows a **"gear system"** approach where each gear adds incremental complexity:

- **Gear 1 (‚úÖ Complete)**: Single agent, sequential execution, manual review
- **Gear 2 (üìã Current Phase)**: Two-agent system, automated review, one improvement cycle
- **Gear 3 (Future)**: Ever-Thinker, learning system, advanced QA
- **Gear 4 (Future)**: Monitoring, self-healing, multi-project

**Diagrams are organized by gear below.** Start with Gear 1 to understand the foundation, then progress to Gear 2.
